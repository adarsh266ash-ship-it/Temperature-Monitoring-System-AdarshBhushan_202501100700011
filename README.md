#IoT Temperature Monitoring System (Python)

This project simulates an IoT-based temperature monitoring system using Python.
It continuously generates random temperature values and displays messages based on predefined minimum and maximum temperature limits.

#Project Description

The program mimics temperature data received from an assumed IoT sensor and performs real-time monitoring by:

Accepting minimum and maximum temperature limits

Generating random temperature values every 2 seconds

Comparing the generated temperature with the limits

Displaying appropriate alert messages

#Objectives

Build a Python program to display messages according to temperature received from an assumed IoT system

Accept minimum and maximum temperature limits from the user

Generate random temperature values at every 2-second interval

Compare temperature with limits and display appropriate status messages

#Technologies Used

Python

Built-in libraries:

random

time
